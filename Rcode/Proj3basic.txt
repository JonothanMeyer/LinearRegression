Exercise 1 (4 points): Using the a data set from the textbook, perhaps one of those
mentioned in the ve exercises at the end of Chapter 1 (page 12), identify two variables
for which a simple linear regression model seems appropriate based on residual analysis and
other diagnostic methods. Complete each of the following steps:

The 'prostate' data set from the Faraway library was choosen for analysis in this project. Cancer volume,
transformed logorithmiclly was choosen as the prediction variable, denoted 'lcavol', and prostate weight
transformed logorithmically and denoted 'lcp' was choosen as the response variable.

(1) Compute point estimates of Beta1, Beta0, and sigma. Y = Beta0 + Beta1(x) + E
A linear model was made of the predictor and response data using the lm() function in R-Studio. The point
estimates of Beta1 = .80, Beta0 = -1.26, and sigma = 1.04.

(2) Identify a predictor variable value in the range of your original data that is not
actually sampled in your original data set; call this x*. Construct a point estimate
of MewY|x=x*|

4 was choosen as the unknown lcavol value. Plugging x*=4 into our model equation y = -1.26 + .80 * 4 yields
a value of 1.94. So the estimated response of having cancer volume at a logarithmic level of 4 will be 
1.94 logarithmic units of prostate weight based off of our model. 

(3) Identify a confidence level of your choice and construct a confidence interval estimate
of Beta1 that uses that confidence level. 

Using a 95% confidence interval and the confint(linear model) function on R, we found the confidence interval
estimate of Beta1 to be (.62,.98). Meaning we can say that there is a 95% that the true slope for modeling
this data lies between .62 and .98 if our assumptions surrounding the model are correct. These numbers were
confirmed by doing manual calculation of the confidence interval on R as well. 

(4) Using the same confidence level, construct a confidence interval estimate of MewY|x=x*|
The estimated reponse of an x*=4 according to our model equation is 1.94. Using R, a direct calculation of 
a 95% CI at x*=4 was found to be (1.43,2.46) using the following lines of code:

	xframe<-as.data.frame(4) 
	colnames(xframe)<-"lcavol"
	predict(mv.lm,xframe,interval="conf",level=.95) # This function produced the CI: (1.43, 2.46)

This confidence interval was confirmed doing a manual calculation on R by using the nessisary formulas that
calculate the mean of x, Sxx, response value, sd of residuals, and Syhat. This was done using the following R code:

	xstar<- 4
	mean.x<-mean(prostate$lcavol)
	s.res<- sd(residuals(mv.lm)) #1.031255
	sxx<-sum((prostate$lcavol-mean.x)^2)
	ypred<-b0+b1*xstar
	s.xstar<-s.res*(1/n.samp+(xstar-mean.x)^2/sxx)^.5
	c(ypred-qt(1-.05/2,n.samp-2)*s.xstar,
  	ypred+qt(1-.05/2,n.samp-2)*s.xstar) #<-produces the lower and upper bounds of CI

(5) Using the same confidence level, construct a prediction interval for a new response
variable value, y|x = x*|.

Using the same methodology I desired to estimate a 95% prediction interval for a response of x*=5. At this
response level we can say that 95% of the time the response will be between .57 and 4.91 units of prostate
weight or, (.57,4.91) units of lcavol. This was found using the following code from R:
	xframe<-as.data.frame(5)
	colnames(xframe)<-"lcavol"
	predict(mv.lm,xframe,interval="pred",level=.95)

Exercise 2 (8 points): Consider the `prostate' data set from the textbook. Construct a
linear model using `lcavol ' as a response variable and `lpsa ' as a response variable. Include
each of the following steps.

(1) Randomly partition the data set into a model calibration part consisting of 80% of
the data set and a model validation component consisting of the other 20% of the
data set.

The prostate data was randomly partitioned into a model calibraion with 80% of the data contained
in a variable called 'development' and a variable called 'holdout' consisting of the other 20%.

(2) Compute point estimates of Beta1, Beta0, and sigma using the model calibration part of the
data set.

Constructing a linear model of the 'development' data set produced point estimates Beta1 = .73, Beta0 = 1.48, 
and sigma = .74

(3) Identify a confidence level of your choice and construct a confidence interval estimate
of Beta1 using the model calibration part of the data set.

For a confidence level of 95% the range for Beta1 is estimated between (.59,.88). Meaning that if our model 
is correct there is 95% chance that the true slope for modeling this data lies between .59 to .88 units of
lcp. This was found using confint(development.lm, level=.95) in R.

(4) Construct a 95% prediction interval estimate of Mew|lcavol|lpsa for all of the lpsa values in
your validation data set. What proportion of these prediction intervals capture the
observed response?

We used the following R code to find a 95% prediction interval estimate for all of the lpsa values in the
smaller data set (n=20):
	xframe<-as.data.frame(holdout$lpsa)
	sample.lpsa.ci<-data.frame(predict(holdout.lm,xframe, interval="pred",level=.95))
This was used to find the following output of prediction intervals:

we then used the following R code to see if the response fell within each data sample's predictive range:
	Observed.cavol<-data.frame(holdout$lcavol) #store actual response value in a data frame
	range<-c(sample.lpsa.ci$lwr,sample.lpsa.ci$upr,Observed.cavol) #store lwr/upper bounds of lpsa in data.frame
	Observed.cavol > range$lwr & Observed < range$upr #calculate if the response fell in that range. 

Output:

100% of the response's fell within the 95% predictive range. 

(5) Plot a 95% confidence band computed from the model calibration part of the original
data set on a scatterplot of that part of the calibration data set.

(6) Plot a 95% confidence band computed from the model calibration part of the data set
on a scatterplot of the model validation part of the data set that includes a regression
line computed using the model validation part of the data set.

Exercise 3 (8 points): Complete Textbook Exercise 2, parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) from
Chapter 3 (page 49), stated as follows. Thirty samples of cheddar cheese were analyzed for
their content of acetic acid, hydrogen sulfide and lactic acid. Each sample was tasted and
scored by a panel of judges and the average taste score produced. Use the cheddar data to
answer the following:
 
(a) Fit a regression model with taste as the response and the three chemical con-tents as
predictors. Identify the predictors that are statistically significant at the 5% level.

(b) Acetic and H2S are measured on a log scale. Fit a linear model where all three pre-
dictors are measured on their original scale. Identify the predictors that are statistically
significant at the 5% level for this model.

(c) (skip part (c) for now, part (c) addressed on future worksheet)

(d) If H2S is increased 0.01 for the model used in (a), what change in the taste would
be expected?

(e) What is the percentage change in H2S on the original scale corresponding to an ad-
ditive increase of 0.01 on the (natural) log scale?
